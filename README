This is a simple Python script which lets me keep track of my tasks and their
time. It helps me a lot in my work with the ticketing system so I can see
precisely how much time it took for specific tasks.

It is not finished yet, but it is usable. It's tested on Linux.  After the
first run the script sets up its directories in $HOME/.task.

In order to be able to work on the same tasks on multiple computers, I've set
up $HOME/.task as a link to my Dropbox folder.
To add a new task do:
task add
This will open up your $EDITOR and let you edit the task category and
description. Currently the category is taken to be the first word of the
description so that you should preferably format your tasks like this:

Project1: short description
More detailed description

To see all of active tasks:
task list
This displays all active tasks (by default). If you want to see tasks from the
current week, type:
task list -w 0
If you want the week before:
task list -w 1
and so on. If you want tasks from a specific month (say September):
task list -m 9
from October:
task list -m 10
and so on. For tasks from specific year type:
task list -y 2011

If your task is done do:
task done
Then it is moved to history:
task history
The date ranges for history are same as for list with the exception that only
tasks from current week are shown in history by default.

If you have a different task but you're not finished with the current one:
task push
to make this task active (but not current) and then either
task add
to add a new task or:
task pop [num]
to pop task with number [num] (active/history tasks work as a FILO stack).

More info can be found in the source code.

Happy using and please give feedback! :)
