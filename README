This is a simple Python script which lets me keep track of my tasks and their
time. It helps me a lot in my work with the ticketing system so I can see
precisely how much time it took for specific tasks.

It is not finished yet, but it is usable. It's tested on Linux.  After the
first run the script sets up its directories in $HOME/.task.

In order to be able to work on the same tasks on multiple computers, I've set
up $HOME/.task as a link to my Dropbox folder.
To add a new task do:
task add
To see all of active tasks:
task list
If your task is done do:
task done
Then it is moved to history:
task history
If you have a different task but you're not finished with the current one:
task push
to make this task active (but not current) and then either
task add
to add a new task or:
task pop [num]
to pop task with number [num] (active/history tasks work as a FILO stack).
